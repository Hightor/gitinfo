    The `gitinfo' package provides to allow version control metadata
to be incorporated into documents. The metadata is obtained from
the git distributed version control system.
    For `memoir' users, the package can, optionally, tailor some
page headers and footers with certain metadata.

    gitinfo is licenced under the LPPL. For more details,
please see the accompanying manual: gitinfo.pdf.
